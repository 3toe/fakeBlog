      <h1 class="hideMe">Welcome to Ash's Blog</h1>
      <p>Hello! You've stumbled upon the blog of the most talented kitty in the world.</p> 
      <map name="password">

      <p>I enjoy running around like a lunatic, climbing humans, attacking plants and web design.  My roomates will sometimes leave me bottlecaps which is really amazing, cause I carry them in my mouth over to the bathtub, drop them in there and then bat them all over the place for long periods of time.</p>
      <p>One thing that is very apparent to me is that if you are a cat and are into web design, other professionals tend to not take you seriously.  This is why I've decided to create this blog.  Here you will be able to follow me and my various projects in software, as I complete them.  My first one will be to create a blockchain and a cryptocurrency that directly competes with DogeCoin, that is to say, does very little aside from attract memelords and pump and dump schemes. But why should DOGS have all the fun? Move over Doge, here comes AshCoin!</p>
      <p>And another thing, who decided <span id="laser">lasers</span> are fair? My next project will be a way to finally catch those annoying, red devils.</p>

      <ul>
         <li>I like white fish a lot.</li>
         <li>I also like treats, and usually only get them when I'm asked to do something stupid like sit down or stand on two legs</li>
         <li>My roommates programmed a machine to feed me, but it doesn't dispense wet food so I hate it.</li>
         <li>I love whipped cream and can hear a can of it being shaken from across the county.</li>
